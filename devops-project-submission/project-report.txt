Project Report – DevOps Website Deployment

1. Overview
I created a fully responsive 5-page website using HTML and CSS. 
The pages include Home, About, Services, Gallery, and Contact.
After building the website locally, I uploaded it to GitHub and deployed it on an AWS EC2 instance using Nginx.
This project helped me understand EC2 setup, security groups, Linux commands, Git workflow, and website hosting.

2. Step-by-Step Process

Step 1: Create Website
- Built all pages: index.html, about.html, services.html, gallery.html, contact.html
- Created a separate CSS file for design
- Linked all pages through a navigation bar
- Tested website locally

Step 2: Add Website to GitHub
- Created a new GitHub repository
- Uploaded all website files
- Added README.md
- Added screenshots folder

Step 3: Launch EC2 Instance
- Ubuntu 22.04
- t2.micro free tier
- Added rules for SSH (22) and HTTP (80)
- Attached Elastic IP

Step 4: Connect EC2 via SSH
Commands used:
chmod 400 key.pem
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<http://13.204.244.158/Home.html>

Step 5: Install Nginx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx

Step 6: Deploy Website to EC2
git clone <https://github.com/Rahulsharma1199/business-website-project.git>
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
sudo mv project-folder/* /var/www/html/
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Step 7: Test Website
Opened: http://<http://13.204.244.158>
Website loaded successfully.

3. Errors Faced

Error 1: CSS not loading  
Reason: wrong path  
Fix: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

Error 2: Image names causing issues  
Fix: removed spaces in file names (about.png, home.png)

Error 3: Permission denied in /var/www/html  
Fix:
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html

Error 4: Git not installed on EC2  
Fix:
sudo apt install git -y

4. How I Solved Them
- Used correct file paths  
- Renamed files without spaces  
- Fixed folder permissions  
- Installed missing packages  
- Re-tested website after every step  

5. Final Screenshots (stored in screenshots/)
- EC2 dashboard  
- Elastic IP  
- Terminal SSH  
- Git clone  
- Nginx status  
- Website live view  
- Local website screenshots
